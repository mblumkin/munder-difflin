/**
 * Regression for the inoperative HOP_CAP loop guard. routeMessage() checked
 * `msg.hops > HOP_CAP` with a "loop guard — drop a runaway message" comment,
 * but the harness never incremented hops and every bounce path spread `...msg`
 * unchanged: normalize copied the agent-supplied value verbatim, so the guard
 * compared a frozen 0 against 12 forever while a god↔hookless-worker relay
 * loop delivered a duplicate bounce (plus a log line and a git commit) every
 * router tick. Conversely an outbox JSON echoing `hops: 13` — a field
 * PROTOCOL.md says the HARNESS fills in — had its first delivery dropped.
 *
 * The fix makes hops harness-owned end to end: normalize clamps the
 * agent-carried value into [0, HOP_CAP] so a copied-forward count can neither
 * fake a runaway loop nor read as one, and the four harness bounce paths now
 * go through bounceToGod(), the only place the counter moves (+1 per bounce),
 * where the cap fuse actually fires — and only on a real relay loop.
