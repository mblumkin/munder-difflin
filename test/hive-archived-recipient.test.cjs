// worker re-hired under the same id reads it on its first turn, and a released
// worker's inbox is settled only up to its done signal — but the sender learned
// nothing: god kept mailing dead agents for hours (seen live 2026-08-16), and a
// request to a worker nobody re-hired was simply lost. Now a message that
// expects an answer (request / query / propose) is filed AND its sender gets an
// immediate inform saying so; inform-only mail is filed quietly.
