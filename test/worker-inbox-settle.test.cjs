// A worker that signaled done is finished with the mail it had when it did.
//
// Before this: an ephemeral worker's inbox was left exactly as the worker left
// it when it was released, and workers seldom file their own work order under
// inbox/.done before signaling done. The worker id is `worker-<request name>`,
// reused on every re-hire of the same name, so each new incarnation booted into
// its predecessors' finished orders: the boot nudge told it to "work everything
// still pending", it spent its first turns re-triaging tasks its memory said
// were done, and the inbox-wake watchdog read the oldest order as mail that had
// gone unanswered for 21 hours. Seen live 2026-09-07: 13 of 30 worker inboxes
// on one floor carried finished orders, one of them three deep.
//
// The release path now files whatever was still unread WHEN THE WORKER SIGNALED
// DONE. Only the DONE path does — an idle or token-cap reap never signaled
// completion, so its mail stays pending — and only mail from before the signal:
// a follow-up that crossed the worker's done was never seen by anyone, so it
// stays pending too. Requests and queries filed unread are reported back to god.
